## About
This repository contains python scripts for Raspberry Pi (target HW is Pi Zero 2 W), which supports my homebrewing setup. The overall setup consists of two fermentation chambers based on chest freezers with temperature controllers and a kegerator that supports two corny kegs built from a minifridge.

## Fermentation Chambers
Each fermentation chamber supports a 40L Spiedel Fermenter and has a temperature controller connected to the freezer power (cold side) and a reptile heater (warm side). Additionally, each chamber has a chamber temperature sensor and Tilt Hydrometer (under development) connected to the RPI Zero 2 W to monitor fermentation.

## Kegerator
The kegerator fits two corny kegs with picnic taps. The kegerator has an interior temperature sensor and a load cell under each keg connected to the RPI Zero 2 W to measure the amount of beer remaining in each keg.
